Code:
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

# decision tree
tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state = 42)
tree.fit(X, y)
inst = np.array([4,0]) 
inst = inst.reshape(1,-1) 
y_pred = tree.predict(inst) # prediction
print(y_pred) # print the prediction
np.random.seed(3) # seed
n = 3
idxs = np.random.randint(X.shape[0], size=3)
inst_t = X[idxs,:]
y_pred = tree.predict(inst_t)

d) The predictive label of the instance 664 is 0

Correct answer : a) & b)

Q2. Use the following code to compute the accuracy_score:
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
y_pred = tree.predict(X)
accuracy_score(y_pred,y)

Correct answer : 0.90

Q3. 
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay

Correct answer : b) and d)

Q5. Initialize a Decision Tree classifier (name the model clf) and fit on the data with a random_state: 42 and max_depth : 3 (the maximum depth of our decision tree using the max_depth parameter).

Calculate the accuracy score of the training dataset. Select the correct answer.

a) 0.901
b) 0.908
c) 0.808
